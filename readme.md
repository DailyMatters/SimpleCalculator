This is a very simple php Calculator class that I created with the intention of testing php package generation and integration with Travis.

For this example the following concepts ( technologies ) were used:
- PSR-4 standard ( http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/ ) 
- Composer
- Git
- Travis CI ( https://travis-ci.org/DailyMatters/SimpleCalculator.svg?branch=master )
- phpunit

With these resources you can create a php psr-4 package ready to be deployed on github or packagist.

Currently calculates the basic operations, percentage, basic trigonometric functions, pi value and base 10 logarithm.

Best regards,
