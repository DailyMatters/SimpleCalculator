This is a very simple php Calculator class that I created with the intention of testing php package generation and integration with Travis.

For this example the following concepts ( technologies ) were used:
- PSR-4 standard ( http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/ ) 
- Composer
- Git
- Travis CI
- phpunit

With these resources you can create a php psr-4 package ready to be deployed on github or packagist.
